Free addon for the Yoast SEO plugin to hide the bloat it adds to the WordPress backend. See [changelog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-clean-up-wp-seo/#developers) for what's new in this release.

== Description ==

Almost anyone who uses the Yoast SEO plugin will agree that it is a good SEO plugin, but the developers are adding more and more unwanted things to the WordPress backend.

**New in this version:**

* previous hide readability features setting (our v3.9.0) was blocking the icons of SEO and Readability tab of Yoast metabox; now not anymore

<hr>

The purpose of the Hide SEO Bloat plugin, a free addon for the Yoast SEO plugin, is to clean up all those unwanted things.

The Settings page of the plugin shows checkboxes for everything. Ticking the box means hiding (or removing) that particular "feature".

It is a good idea to have a look at the Settings page if only to see what you can fine-tune. The link to the page has been added to the Yoast SEO menu and of course there is also a link to it from the Plugins page.

The **Default Settings** of the current release are as follows:

* hides the cartoon-style sidebar ads on almost all settings pages of the Yoast SEO plugin
* hides the tagline nag showing as a Problem in the Yoast SEO Dashboard
* hides the robots nag showing as a Problem in the Yoast SEO Dashboard and in the advanced tab of Yoast SEO UI in edit Post/Page screen when your site is blocking access to robots
* hides the Upsell Notice in the Notification box that shows in the Yoast SEO Dashboard
* hides the Upsell Notice in social tab of Yoast Post/Page metabox
* hides the Premium Upsell Admin Block that shows in the entire Yoast SEO backend
* hides "Premium" submenu in its entirety
* hides "Go Premium" metabox on edit Post/Page screens
* hides Post/Page/Taxonomy Deletion Premium Ad
* hides Problems box from Yoast SEO Dashboard
* hides Notifications box from Yoast SEO Dashboard
* hides image warning nag that shows in edit Post/Page screen when featured image is smaller than 200x200 pixels
* hides check Configuration wizard box that shows on top of most admin screens
* hides issue counter from adminbar and sidebar
* hides new readability "features" of Post/Page metabox
* hides ad for premium version in help center
* hides the SEO Score, Readability, Title, Meta Description, Outgoing Internal Links admin columns on the Posts/Pages screens; Focus keyword column can be hidden too
* hides the SEO Score and Readability admin columns on taxonomies
* hides SEO Settings on individual profile page
* removes primary category feature
* removes the Yoast SEO admin bar menu
* removes the Yoast SEO widget from the WordPress Dashboard
* removes Courses menu from sidebar
* hides SEO Scores Dropdown Filters on the Edit Posts/Pages screen
* hides Keyword/Content Score from the Publish/Update Metabox on the Edit Post/Page/CPT screen

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the settings page? =

The link to the page has been added to the Yoast SEO menu and of course there is also a link to it from the Plugins page.

= Can I use Hide SEO Bloat on Multisite? =

Yes, you can.
For version 2.4.0 [Andy Fragen](https://github.com/afragen) has refactored that part of the plugin to make it fully Multisite compatible. The Settings screen only shows in Network Admin as we don't think it makes sense that individual sites override the Network Settings.

= Does Hide SEO Bloat work with ClassicPress? =

Yes, the Hide SEO Bloat can also be used on sites that are running ClassicPress. Of course it is also necessary to have the Yoast SEO plugin installed.

= The name of the plugin is confusing, it hides bloat of which SEO plugin? =

Yes, you are right, the name is a bit vague (see Changelog v1.8.0). On the other hand there is only one SEO plugin that adds a lot of bloat to the WordPress Dashboard and that is the Yoast SEO plugin.

= The plugin doesn't do anything! =

Do you have the Yoast SEO plugin installed? It hides the bloat from that plugin only.
If you have and the plugin still doesn't do anything, then please open a [support ticket](https://github.com/senlin/so-clean-up-wp-seo/issues).

= With a settings page comes additional entries in the database; what happens on uninstall? =

Great question!
Indeed the Hide SEO Bloat plugin writes its settings to the database. The included `uninstall.php` file removes all the plugin-related entries from the database once you remove the plugin via the WordPress Plugins page (not on deactivation).

= I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support? =

Please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-clean-up-wp-seo/issues)

== Screenshots ==

1. settings page with default settings
2. typical nags that are hidden with the plugin activated
3. bloat on edit Post/Page screen that is hidden with the plugin activated
4. SEO menu in admin bar that is partly hidden with the plugin activated
5. dashboard widget that is removed with the plugin activated

= 1.8.0 =

* name change to avoid "Yoast" trademark violation

= 1.5.0 =

* We have changed the name of our plugin to reflect the name change of the plugin it cleans up after

= 1.4.0 =

* Version 2.2.1 of the Yoast SEO plugin changes a lot of things around. The automatic redirect to the plugin's About page is no longer, so we have removed the function that disables it. The new version introduced an updated nag that doesn't let itself be dismissed easily, so we have simply hidden it altogether. The super irritating balloon to follow the intro tour was back again too, we have countered that with a function that sets the user_meta of that intro tour to true, which means "seen".
